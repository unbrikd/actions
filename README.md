# Unbrikd GitHub Actions

This repository contains a collection of GitHub Actions for Unbrikd products. The main goal is to provide a seamless usage of Unbrikd products when using GitHub Actions.

## Usage
Each action must be as self-contained and self-explanatory as possible. The user must be able to use the action just by reading the `README` file available in the action's directory.
Every action's README file provides usage instructions, examples, and a list of inputs and outputs details.
